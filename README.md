# resonance
Harmony Search and HSMA implementation for image segmentation

Resonance is a Harmony Search implementation and will be used for the Harmony Search Multithreshold Algorithm (HSMA) for image segmentation

HSMA is based on a research paper by Diego Oliva et al. titled "Multilevel Thresholding Segmentation Based on
Harmony Search Optimization" and published on the Hindawi Journal of Appplied Mathematics, Volume 2013 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/575414)

For simplicity, both Resonance and the HSMA will be here

This is an asigment for my Digital Image Processing course imparted by Dr. Diego Oliva himself at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara
